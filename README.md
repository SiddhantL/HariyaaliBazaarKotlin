# हरियाली Bazaar

 हरियाली Bazaar is an online supermarket for all your daily vegetable/fruits/beans needs. Online shopping now made easy with a wide range of items, delivered to your doorstep

<b> Problem Statement: </b>
Hariyaali Bazaar provides an easy way to sell daily items to a regular customer base. During these times, with occasional lockdowns/curfews/isolation, going to the grocery can be very risky due to the virus. People need an app for daily items, which are helping their local businesses and not a giant e-commerce corporation. 

<b> Proposed Solution : </b>
I have created an app which will allow my local vegetable vendor to deliver vegetables to the doorstep to people/families living in the area. This removes the need to leave your house to buy essentials at the comfort and safety of your home, this provides an advantage over mega ecommerce corporations as the items have been delivered to you from a local vendor, which guarantees instant replacements/exchange, and we can expect the same quality of items being delivered by the local vendor.

<b> Functionality & Concepts used : </b>

-Room DB, LiveData, ViewModel: They help save the grocery list in-app using the room database, so you don't have to write down your list for tomorrow anywhere else

-Jetpack Navigation Library: Allows for great navigation and animations between fragments and screens

-RecyclerView: To display lists efficiently I have made use of RecyclerView 

-RelativeLayout: The use of RelativeLayout for screens made the placing of views on the app very convenient as there were many elements to be placed

-Firebase Authentication: Helped integrate sign in using phone number very convenient and efficient for no cost(at the current usage)

-Firebase Realtime Database: Firebase Realtime Database helped bridge the gap between the user app and the vendor app, and made fetching, updating and writing data very convenient and efficient 

-Material Design Elements: Helped add elements which made the app look better and made the app much more interactive 

-Glide: To load images in the app 

<b> Application Link & Future Scope : </b>

This application is currently in Beta Test phase, when we launch the app, it will cater to a smaller area, to understand any issues or bugs, modify the app accordingly and with time continue expanding the area.

The app will be launched on playstore
